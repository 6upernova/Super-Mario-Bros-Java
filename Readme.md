# Super Mario Bros - Java Implementation

Welcome to my implementation of **Super Mario Bros** in Java! 🎮✨ This project was developed as part of a group assignment for the course *Tecnología de Programación* at the Universidad Nacional del Sur. It showcases the development of a 2D platformer game inspired by the iconic Mario series. It demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming principles, design patterns, data structures and 
various other programming techniques.

## Features

- **Dynamic Level Design**: Scrolling backgrounds, interactive platforms, and engaging power-ups.
- **Character Animation and Physics**: Smooth movement mechanics including jumping, running, and gravity-based falls.
- **Enemy Interactions**: Different types of enemies with unique behaviors and collision mechanics.
- **Power-Ups and Transformations**: Implementations of items like mushrooms and fire flowers, enabling Mario to transform and gain abilities.
- **Scoring System**: Dynamic point display for defeating enemies and collecting coins.

## Technologies and Skills Demonstrated

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- **Encapsulation**: Clear separation of concerns using classes for entities such as `Mario`, `Enemies`, and `Platforms`. 
- **Inheritance**: Hierarchical structure where entities like `Goomba` and `KoopaTroopa` inherit from a common `Enemy` class. 
- **Polymorphism**: Flexible methods allowing diverse behaviors, such as unique enemy interactions. 

### Design Patterns

- **Observer Pattern**: Implemented for updating graphics and managing animations in real-time. 
- **Visitor Pattern**: Utilized for collision detection and handling interactions between different entities. 
- **Factory Pattern**: Simplified creation of game objects such as enemies, platforms, and power-ups. 

### Game Development Concepts

- **Custom Physics Engine**: Gravity and collision handling for seamless character movement. 
- **Multithreading**: Managing background scrolling, animations, and enemy behaviors using separate threads. 
- **Resource Management**: Efficient handling of sprites, sound effects, and animations.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/6upernova/Super-Mario-Bros-Java.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and build the application using your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) or via the command line. 
3. Run the `Launcher` class to start the game.

## Challenges and Lessons Learned

- **Collision Detection**: Implementing precise interactions between Mario and game entities required meticulous testing. 
- **Performance Optimization**: Balancing graphical updates and game logic to ensure smooth performance. 
- **Scalability**: Designing flexible systems to easily add new features like enemies and power-ups.
